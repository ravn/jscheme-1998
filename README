Experimental mavenization of JScheme 1998. 

Expected usage is as a configuration-with-code file parser
replacing property files. 

Licensing is the same as the original - see original-license.html

Note:  This is a repackaging of the original from

  http://norvig.com/jscheme.html

and not the later, larger version as found on 

  http://jscheme.sourceforge.net/jscheme/main.html


Note:  Can be executed with "java -jar ..." to go in REPL.

Lots of additional tests added preparing for embedded use.

JSR-223 support will most likely be the easiest way to do this.
